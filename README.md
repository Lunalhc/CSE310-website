# CSE310-website

# Overview

{I am trying to build a website that will display different types of information that I learned from the senior project i am doing this semester}

{I mainly used JavaScript to handle the event, because the simple layput or format is taken care of in css file.}

{This project will not only helped me to learn the basic of JavaScript, but will also be useful for my presentation of the senior project at the end of the semester.}

# Development Environment

{ I watched the Youtube playlist of Javascript for beginners, and I used Vs code studio for editing, and download the liveserver extension to be able to view the result real-timely. I asked my frined for suggestions of the website layout, and use chatGPT to decorate the words. I used Google fonts to get different fonts I want to use, I also used OpenArt AI to generate no-copyright pictures. I used videoeditor to trim the video I want to display}

{JavaScript, HTML, CSS}

# Useful Websites
